        2. We get the content of File 2, let that be y. (file2_data)
        3. We store the original content of x into a variable called x, for instance. (file1_data_new)
        4. We write into x as the content of y. (File 1 = File 2)
        5. We write into y as the content of z.
    => Thus, the files are swapped.
