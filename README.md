# Project-98
In this project, I have made the Swapping Files program.

**=>How it works:**

1. We get the content of File 1, let that be x. **(file1_data)**
2. We get the content of File 2, let that be y. **(file2_data)**
3. We store the original content of x into a variable called x, for instance. **(file1_data_new)**
4. We write into x as the content of y. **(File 1 = File 2)**
5. We write into y as the content of z. **(File 2 = File 1)**

**=> Thus, the files are swapped.**
